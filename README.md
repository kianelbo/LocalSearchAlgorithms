# LocalSearchAlgorithms
Implementation of famous AI local search algorithms:
* Hill Climbing (Simple - First Choice - Stochastic - Random Restart)
* Simulated Annealing (w/ various cooling strategies)
* Genetic (Also plots generation statistics using [JFreeChart](http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/))
## Sample modeled problems for algorithms:
* Graph Coloring
